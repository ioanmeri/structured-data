## Rich snippet
If a page has structured data, Google can provide a **"rich snippet"**.

* This includes additional information on a page, like:
	* rating
	* Num of reviews
	* e.g. Film
		* rating
		* runtime
		* when in theaters
		* Genre


Structured Data is an integral part of modern SEO. While it **won't** itself help you **rank better** for your chosen keywords, it should increase **CTR**, which can. But because Google can better understand your content, it can help you **get ranked**.

As with all SEO, don't try to trick the search engines. Spammy structured data can get a manual penalty. Your page HAS to be the best for the search query if it is going to be #1.

We have been focusing on Google, but remember that SD can be read by Google, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.

* Glossary attached, because there is a lot of vocabulary that goes with the topic.
